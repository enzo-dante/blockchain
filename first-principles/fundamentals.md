# blockchain fundamentals

A block is composed of a header of information about the block and a set of valid transactions.

- there was 1 transaction of 50 BTC in the Genesis block in Bitcoin -- the first block in a blockchain.

The transaction uses the amount specified by one or more input UTXOs and transfers it to one or more newly created output UTXOs.

- UTXO = unspent transaction output

basic operations of the blockchain are:

1. validation of transactions
2. gathering transactions for a block
3. broadcasting valid transactions & blocks
4. consensus on next block creation
5. chaining blocks

It true that transaction confirmation is independently performed by all miner nodes.
