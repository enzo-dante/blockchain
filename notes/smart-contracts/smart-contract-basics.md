# a smart contract represents business logic layer

Smart contract has some advantages including, a smart contract facilitates transaction for transfer of assets other than value or cryptocurrency.

It facilitates implementation of policies for transfer of assets in a decentralized network.

Description: Remix is an IDE for the smart contract programming language Solidity and has an integrated debugger and testing environment.

# smart contract definition

According to Ethereum Metropolis version, once a smart contract is deployed it is immutable.

Title of resource: Structure of a Contract

https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/structure-of-a-contract.html

Description: Contracts in Solidity are similar to classes in object-oriented languages. Each contract can contain declarations of State Variables, Functions, Function Modifiers, Events, Struct Types and Enum Types. Furthermore, contracts can inherit from other contracts.

# processing smart contracts

You cannot execute a smart contract from another smart contract.

##### Here are some of the artifacts generated by the Remix smart contract compile process and their use:

ABI, Application Binary Interface, the interface schema for a transaction to invoke functions on the smart contract instance bytecode.

Contract bytecode, this is the bytecode that is executed for instantiating a smart contract on the EVM.
- Think of it like executing a constructor of a smart contract to create an object.

WebDeploy script, this as two items; json script to web application to invoke smart contract function, script for programmatically deploying a smart contract from a web application.

Gas estimates, this provides a gas estimates for deploying the smart contract and for the function invocation.

Function hashes, first four byte of the function signatures to facilitate function invocation by a transaction.

Instance bytecode, the bytecode of the smart contract instance.

# deploying smart contracts

First, a smart contract solution is written in high-level language and compiled bytecode.

An ABI is also generated for high-level language application.
- Example, Web Apps to interact with the binary smart contract.

EVM provides execution environment for a smart contract bytecode.

The smart contract requires an address for itself so that transaction can target it for invocation of its function.

The contract address is generated by hashing the sender's account address and its nonce.
- A unique target account is reserved for smart contract creation and deployment.

If a target's address is zero or null, it is meant for creating a new smart contract using its payload feed.

The payload of a transaction contains the bytecode for the smart contract.
- This code is executed as a part of the transaction execution to instantiate the bytecode for the actual smart contract.
- Similar to how a constructor creates an object, the execution of a smart contract creation transaction results in the deployment of this smart contract code on the EVM.

It is permanently stored in the EVM for future invocation.

What are used to determine the address of a contract?

- address of the creator's account.
- nonce of the creator's account.

Title of resource: Decoding the Enigma of Bitcoin Mining

https://medium.com/all-things-ledger/decoding-the-enigma-of-bitcoin-mining-f8b2697bc4e2

Description: “Bitcoin miners” is somewhat a misleading term. The miners are actually “bookkeepers” and “validators” of the network. It is called as Mining because the algorithm somewhat approximates the declining supply of gold and the miner wins an award (which are the new bitcoins created) for their effort.
