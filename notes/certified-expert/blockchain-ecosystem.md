consensus algorithm is the process of maintaining the ledger transactions synchronized throughout the network to confirm that ledgers are only updated when transactions are approved by the appropriate participants.

- when ledgers do update, they update with the same transactions in the same order.

A scaling issue with Bitcoin is that there can only be 21 million bitcoins in the market and a transaction cannot exceed 1 mg.
- the mg limit means that only 3-4 transactions will be able to process per second which is not an economy of scale.

# crypto-currency mining

miners earn bitcoin from verifying transactions, they must verify 1 megabyte worth of transactions.

in order for miners to add a block of transactions to the blockchain, they have to solve the proof of work algorithm with the timestamp that validates the block.

- any transaction happening on the blockchain has a puzzle associated with it.

    - the puzzle is to solve the nonce -- a random number -- which the miners guess.

- when a miner guesses or approximates the nonce, they confirm the transaction for the network and are rewarded with tokens.

    - guessing the nonce is computationally intensive.
