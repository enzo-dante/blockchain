# no 3rd party intermediaries

in blockchain, trust is placed in cryptographic algorithm for assets on a distributed p2p network instead of a centralized human.
- transactions are verified by distributed nodes.

an example would be not needing a bank to authorize a transaction.
- this eliminates human error from intentionally or unintentionally tampering with the data.

# greater transparency

there is greater transparency since there is no central authority and a copy of the blockchain, which is essentially immutable, is stored on all the nodes in the distributed p2p network.

- each node/peer is responsible for carrying out transactions and validating it.

- to maliciously alter a transaction on block, it would require the alteration of the record on all preceeding and proceeding blocks on all the nodes.

# high availability

since a copy of the blockchain is stored on all the nodes in the distributed p2p network, if one nodes suffers a ddos attack, it won't bring down the entire network.
- the decentralization offers byzantine byzantine fault tolerance.

# high security

each block in a blockchain is connected to all the blocks before it and after it -- like a book.

the use of private-public key pairs as digital signatures assigned to transactions makes it difficult to hack.
- private keys are used for sending transactions.
- public keys are the addresses where you receive the assets.

each transaction are cryptographically secured.

# cost saving

since blockchain doesn't require 3rd party intermediaries, overhead cost & length of time to exchange assets is reduced.

once the data is over a network, it is there forever -- it cannot be removed if a central authority wants it removed.

# traceability

blockchain allows every party to trace assets & ensure integrity over exchanges when visibility & availability eliminate nefarious behavior.

- historical transaction data can help to verify the authenticity of assets & prevent fraud.
