# ethereum smart contracts

a smart contract is a piece of code deployed in the blockchain code that enhances the transfer capability.

- Execution of a smart contract is initiated by a message embedded in a transaction

the code is written in solidity and run on an ethereum virtual machine (evm) which allows the smart contract code to run anywhere.

- Solidity has data, functions or methods with modifiers, along with getter and setter functions.

Miner nodes receive, verify, gather and execute transactions.

Any changes to the value of a state variable in a smart contract are stored on the blockchain.

Ethereum full nodes host the software needed for transaction initiation, validation, mining, block creation, and smart contract execution.

# Incentive Model

GASLIMIT = the amount of gas points available

GASSPENT = actual amount spent at completion of block creation.

the mining incentive model culminates in a proof-of-work puzzle winner miner.

- other miners are called ommers that produce ommer blockes.
